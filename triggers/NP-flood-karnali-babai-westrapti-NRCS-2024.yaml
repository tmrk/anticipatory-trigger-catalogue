      Readiness Trigger (3-5 days lead time)
      The readiness trigger for Karnali, Babai and West Rapti will be reached when Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS) predicts more than 2-year return period flow in next 3 to 5 days with a probability of 50% or more at Chisapani, Chepang and Kusum station respectively.
      Alternatively, the readiness trigger for Babai and West Rapti will also be confirmed when the numerical weather prediction (NWP) from DHM/RIMES or any special weather advisories/bulletin from DHM predicts extreme and widespread rainfall for next three days across those basin areas and districts provided that these rivers are already flowing at stage level less than 2m from existing danger level.

The activation trigger for Babai and West Rapti River will be reached when the DHM flood forecast bulletin or regional flood outlook from ICIMOD or any special flood advisories from DHM predict water levels of Babai and West Rapti to rise to their existing danger levels in Chepang and Kusum station respectively in next 48 hours. However, the evacuation of the most vulnerable population and their livestock will only be implemented once the rivers surpass the danger level (based on the real-time river status from DHM) and are in a rising trend in respective gauging stations. This means there is a stop mechanism in place especially for the action related to the evacuation of the population."

      explanation: Activation is met when DHM flood forecasts (supported by ICIMOD regional flood outlook and DHM special flood advisories) predict that within 48 hours at least one of the three trigger stations will reach its defined threshold river level: 11.8 m (1 m above danger level) at Karnali–Chisapani, or the existing danger levels of 6.8 m at Babai–Chepang or 7.8 m at West Rapti–Kusum.

      boolean_expression: NOT (rt_karnali_chisapani_above_danger_and_rising OR rt_babai_chepang_above_danger_and_rising OR rt_west_rapti_kusum_above_danger_and_rising)
      explanation: Evacuation-related early actions remain paused or are cancelled unless real-time DHM gauges show that at least one of the rivers at the trigger stations has already surpassed its danger level and is in a rising trend; evacuation is only implemented once this real-time confirmation is observed.
