      Readiness Trigger (3-5 days lead time)
      The readiness trigger for Karnali, Babai and West Rapti will be reached when Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS) predicts more than 2-year return period flow in next 3 to 5 days with a probability of 50% or more at Chisapani, Chepang and Kusum station respectively.
      Alternatively, the readiness trigger for Babai and West Rapti will also be confirmed when the numerical weather prediction (NWP) from DHM/RIMES or any special weather advisories/bulletin from DHM predicts extreme and widespread rainfall for next three days across those basin areas and districts provided that these rivers are already flowing at stage level less than 2m from existing danger level.
      For the real-time monitoring of triggers, the existing IBF in the BIPAD system shall be utilized, which will fetch the GLOFAS data and put a readiness alert in the system. Regarding the DHM Forecast bulletin and other relevant rainfall forecast sources, this will be manually monitored by the NRCS (with support from Climate Centre and DHM) and accordingly, the activation trigger will be confirmed.
