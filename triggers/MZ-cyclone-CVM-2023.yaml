      Based on the level of the alert, INGC calls a meeting of the Technical Committee for Disaster Management (CTGC), of which CVM is a member. If the CTGC decides to send out a disaster alert, CVM (and others) can start acting, i.e. only following the official announcement of an alert by the CTGC can CVM activate the EAP.
      The threshold or trigger for activation of this EAP will be a category 3 cyclone with an anticipated speed of 120 km/h or more at landfall, as indicated by INAM in their 72-hour forecast.
      In exceptional cases, the EAP may be activated below the trigger threshold of 120 km/h it means 100km/h based on expert consensus, if levels of vulnerability have significantly increased at the time of activation due to compounding risks...
