      Stage 1 – ‘On your marks’
      INGD issue a BLUE advisory when a Tropical Disturbance (TD) is detected in the ocean, with a potential to develop into a cyclone. The public is informed to stay alert and prepared for possible worsening conditions. Blue advisories are also issued when a Tropical Cyclone (TC) is more than 500 km offshore within the Mozambique Channel but may affect the coast in the coming days. The lead-time of the advisory will vary depending on formation of the system. However, on average from the past cyclones, there is typically a lead-time of 5 to 7 days between the advisory and landfall.
      Trigger statement: INGD issue a BLUE cyclone advisory with an estimated minimum 5-day lead time stating that a Tropical Disturbance has potential to develop into a Tropical Cyclone OR when a cyclone is more than 500 km from the coast within the Mozambique Channel.

      Stage 2 – ‘Get Set’
      INGD issue a YELLOW warning or ‘watch’, when a Tropical Cyclone (TC) is 250–500 km offshore and is expected to make landfall Mozambique within 72 hours with windspeeds of greater than 150 km/h (Category 1) and / or less than 980 hPa of central pressure. Alerts are issued to at-risk regions following the forecasted trajectory of the TC, advising people to start taking protective measures.

      Stage 3 – ‘Go’
      INGD issue a RED warning when a Tropical Cyclone 250 km offshore is expected to make landfall within 48 hours. This also provides information on the observed wind speed and a forecast trajectory including forecast wind speeds and the rainfall. At this stage, anticipatory humanitarian action is triggered in the target zones with the designed AAPs.
      Trigger statement: INGD issue a red cyclone watch warning stating that a Tropical Cyclone is 250 km from the coast and expected to impact Mozambique within 48 hours with windspeeds of greater than 150 km/h (Category 1) and / or less than 980 hPa of central pressure. 
      Stop mechanism (summary):
      Updated forecast information – trajectory changes: If INAM, based on Cyclocane, Zoom Earth, or other models, identifies a significant shift in the cyclone's trajectory away from the target districts of Metuge and Montepuez, anticipatory actions will be halted. Reduction in intensity: If forecasts indicate a decrease in cyclone intensity below Category 1 (winds < 150 km/h or central pressure > 980 hPa), stopping anticipatory actions will be considered. Rapid cyclone intensification: If the cyclone's intensity escalates to levels that pose risks to responders or communities (e.g., pressure < 945 hPa), activities will be suspended. Emergent ground truth data: If local data from the Centre of Emergency Operations or field officers contradicts forecasted risks, anticipatory actions may be paused for reassessment. Access constraints due to pre-emptive flooding: If flash or river flooding occurs, impeding access to vulnerable areas or rendering planned actions unfeasible, anticipatory activities may need to be halted.
